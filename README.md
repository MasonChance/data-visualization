# Data-Visualization

The purpose of this project is to analyze data from a chosen data set and find a story to tell with it, using the matplotlib and seaborn libraries in a Jupyterlab interactive notebook to visually represent the data. datasets were chosen from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

We will be using [Google-Play store data](#) to see if we can identify a potentially underserved market or a market suffering from oversaturation. 
We will be using [Nvidia timeseries day trade data](#) to identify potential patterns for portfolio and day trade management
